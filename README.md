## 📚 Structure

### **1. Math Fundamentals (`1_math/`)**

Foundational concepts every researcher must command:

* Functions, derivatives, and gradients
* Vectors, matrices, and linear algebra operations
* Probability, distributions, and statistical reasoning

### **2. PyTorch Basics (`2_pytorch/`)**

Hands-on introduction to the deep learning workbench:

* Creating and manipulating tensors
* Matrix multiplication, transposing, reshaping
* Indexing, slicing, and concatenation
* Special tensor creation utilities

### **3. Neural Networks (`3_neural_networks/`)**

Build the inner machinery of learning systems step by step:

* Implementing neurons, layers, and full networks from scratch
* Normalization methods (including RMSNorm)
* Activation functions and their behavior
* Optimizers such as Adam, Muon, and learning rate schedules

### **4. Transformers (`4_transformers/`) 🔄**

Dive into the architectures powering modern AI systems:

* Attention Mechanism
* Self-Attention
* Multi-Head Attention
* Decoder-Only Transformers
